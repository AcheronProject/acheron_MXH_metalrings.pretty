# Acheron MXH "metal rings" KiCad footprint library

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gondolindrim/acheronLibrary/master/graphics/acheronReadme.png "Acheron Logo")

## Introduction

Acheron MXH "metal rings" is the AcheronProject's library for MX footprint switches using Kailh hotswap sockets (part number CPG151101S11) with metallized rings around the socket connector holes. The footprints were independently developed using the MX switch datasheet and the Kailh hotswap sockets datasheet.

## How to use

1. Clone the git repository into a ``libraries`` folder inside your KiCad project main folder, also known was ``${KIPRJMOD}``
2. In PCBNEW, go into ``Preferences > Manage Footprint Libraries... `` then under the Project tab, press the plus sign and select the ``acheron_MXH_metalrings.pretty`` folder.
3. After that the library footprints should be available for addition in the PCB layout from the ``Add a footprint`` button. Click that button or press O and try adding a footprint from the library like the ``MXH100`` footprint.
